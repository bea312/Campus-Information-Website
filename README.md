# Gisenyi  University | Campus Information Portal

### Project Description

This project is a modern, professional, and responsive single-page Campus Information Website. It serves as a centralized hub for students to access campus services, view facility highlights, and stay updated with live announcements. The design focuses on high scannability and a clean UI, utilizing advanced CSS layout techniques to organize complex information effectively.

### Layout Behaviors Demonstrated

The project showcases several key CSS3 layout and positioning behaviors:

* **Sticky Navigation:** The header remains fixed at the top of the viewport during scrolling for constant access to navigation links.
* **Asymmetric CSS Grid:** The Campus Highlights gallery uses `grid-row: span 2` and `grid-column: span 2` to create a masonry-style layout for featured images.
* **Flexbox Alignment:** Student service cards are organized using a flexible container that ensures even spacing and alignment across different screen sizes.
* **Sticky Sidebar Alerts:** The "Urgent Alert" notice uses `position: sticky` within a flex-container, allowing the alert to remain visible while the user scrolls through a long list of general notices.
* **Interactive Display Logic:** Demonstrates the use of `display: none` for element removal and `visibility: hidden` combined with `:hover` for interactive content discovery.

### List of Project Files

* **index.html**: Contains the semantic HTML5 structure, including navigation, introduction, and the four main content sections.
* **style.css**: An external stylesheet (linked in the HTML) containing all design properties, grid definitions, and positioning logic.

### Would you like me to help you generate the final version of the `style.css` file that perfectly integrates these specific behaviors
